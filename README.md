# Learning from the classic MNIST dataset
This simple neural network attempts to classify MNIST images, as I am aware many, many, many people have already done. However, this project is primarily focused on solidifying my knowledge on feedforward neural networks before I move on to more complex learning models. 

# Benefits
  - Relatively easy to use
  - Honestly, that is this project's central benefit. I do not expect it to work faster or more accurately than the neural networks built by experts in the machine learning field, obviously. However, if you are also looking to develop a ffnn from scratch, looking at this project may be instructional. Furthermore, I would highly, HIGHLY, recommend checking out Michael Nielsen's online (and free!) book: http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com.
  
# So, how do I use it?
Well, check out the Wiki! I am doing my best to document everything in an easy to understand way so that even if you are not familiar with machine learning, you should be able to use this.
