# What is this?
This folder just contains the weights and biases from a network that I have previously trained. It may be useful to run this pre-trained neural network in order to ensure that everything is working properly, or if you don't want to spend the time or the computing resources on training the model. Instructions on how to set this up are in the main README.md.

### Please also note that this network only performs with 97.78% accuracy on the test set
